# LE CHAT ET LES RATS

There once was a house that was infested with rats. 

Having learnt of this, a cat went over and caught them one by one.

Seeing their friends getting caught, the other rats retreated back into their holes. 

Since he could no longer reach them, the cat knew he had to think of a trick to get them out. 

He climbed up to a wooden board and played dead. 

One of the rats stuck out his head to see. Seeing him, it said: 

"Hey my friend. Even if you were a bag, I wouldn't go near you."


*This fable shows that once a sensible man has experienced the wickedness of certain people, they won't fall for their tricks again.
